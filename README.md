# Healthcare
This project represents series of actions and steps carried out to clean, prepare and analyse the Healthcare dataset to derive insights and trends. Thus, the project is divided into two parts; cleaning and analysis. 
Data cleaning and analysis were mostly carried out with Microsoft SQL Server 2019, thus most of the data extracts are still in figures. However, I periodically infused some charts in the report to make it less congested and reader friendly. Overall, working with this dataset was totally enjoyable, as I was able to extract valuable data inclinations.
